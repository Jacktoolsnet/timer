## Playing
Press Play to enable audio. One orbit = four beats, sixteen steps. Eight available orbits, five enabled initially. Expand a track and toggle “Enable orbit” to add or remove it; points are preserved while disabled. Orbit spacing and drawing zones adapt to enabled tracks.
Draw on Flow: vertical position selects the instrument, horizontal position the beat; quick motion adds an adjacent beat, turns change the pentatonic marimba pitch. The trail fades; the pattern remains.
Click orbit points or expand an instrument for keyboard-accessible step controls, mute and volume.
Focus exits via its button or Escape. Playback pauses on hidden tabs. Reduced-motion preference suppresses waves and wedge trails.
DE, EN, ES, FR, eight shared palettes, four visual styles, light/dark/automatic, optional appearance persistence. Drawings and patterns are session-only.

## Prototype scope
Fourteen synthesized instruments selectable per orbit (expand an instrument row): Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat, Bass, Marimba, Clap, Tom, Rimshot, Shaker, Glockenspiel, Kalimba, Pluck synth, Synth bass and Soft pad. Switching preserves beat points; melodic instruments share a C-minor pentatonic scale. Instrument choices are session-only; no recording/export yet. Web Audio lookahead scheduling. Shared JackTools appearance. Canonicals, language alternates, robots and sitemap target sound.jacktools.net.
